                Newlywed Isra thought life would be 
                different when she immigrated to
                America from Palestine, but her
                dreams were quickly dashed.
                You’ll need to steel yourself the
                more you delve into Etaf Rum's 
                penetrating debut novel A Woman Is
                No Man, which follows Isra’s journey,
                and that of her daughter Deya. The clash 
                between dual cultures creates much of the drama,
                as Deya tries to do what her mother ultimately
                couldn’t--break free from their family’s
                violent, misogynistic past and forge her own path 
                in life. While A Woman Is No Man is a rallying cry 
                to resist patriarchal strictures designed to keep women in ‘their place,’ it is also a love 
                letter to books and their 
                transformative power. Reading was one of the only comforts,
                and acts of rebellion, that Isra enjoyed, and she had a particular
                affinity for literary heroine Scheherazade: “For a thousand and one nights [her] stories were resistance.
                Her voice was a weapon—a reminder of the extraordinary power of stories, and even more, the strength of a single woman.”
                They say write what you know, and while A Woman Is No
                Man is not autobiographical, the themes 
                within it are something Etaf Rum is
                intimately familiar with. Here, she 
                talks about how books broke her world open.

                As a first generation Arab-American
                woman raised in a very sheltered and 
                nservative household in Brooklyn, I
                grew up feeling quite isolated. 
                Because I often felt unseen in my 
                community, I found myself resorting 
                to books to help me connect to the 
                outside world. They were the bridge
                that took me out of our two-bedroom 
                partment in Brooklyn and around the globe. 
            </p>
            <p>
                From a young age, I read everything I 
                could get my hands on, seeking out 
                connection and understanding through 
                stories. Since my own story as an 
                Arab-American woman was seldom represented
                in books and literature, I found myself 
                surprised by how seen I felt in unlikely 
                narratives. This sense of connection not
                only helped ease my feelings of loneliness
                and displacement, but it also allowed me to
                see the world through a more inclusive
                lens and helped me understand my place in it.

                As a woman in an insular, patriarchal
                community, I was raised on fear, 
                shame, silence, and obedience. As a 
                result, I often felt voiceless and 
                afraid to speak up, even when I knew 
                should. Whenever I witnessed injustices 
                occurring around me, I curled up inside 
                of a book in attempt to make sense of 
                them. On the rare occasions I did manage 
                speak up---Why is marriage a woman’s only 
                aspiration? Why are only men encouraged to
                go to college? Why is it okay for a man to 
                ose his virginity before marriage but 
                not a woman? Why is it okay for a man 
                to beat his wife? Why are women expected 
                to endure these injustices in silence?---I
                always heard the same answer: because a 
                woman is not a man. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After many years of being silenced and 
                afraid, books are what helped me build
                the courage to speak up against these
                injustices and tell the stories of the
                women in my debut novel, A Woman Is
                No Man, who live in the same insular
                community where I grew up. If it 
                weren’t for books, there would have
                been no way for me to truly understand
                the toxicity of this community or the reality
                of my life.

                It was only through books and stories—which
                allowed me to educate myself not only 
                intellectually, but mentally and emotionally—that
                I was able to make the connection between the
                life that I was living, with all its limitations,
                and the endless possibilities of what my life 
                could be like if I broke free of the narrative 
                that had been written for me. And that’s the
                power that books and stories have had on my 
                life—not only have they given me a sense of 
                connection and allowed me to understand my 
                narrative in the world, they have helped me 
                build the strength and courage to rewrite it.
