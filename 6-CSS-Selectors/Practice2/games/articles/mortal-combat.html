                C2E2 has come and passed once again. The Chicago Comic and Entertainment 
                Expo brings some of the coolest geek celebrities and events to the second city, 
                and as always, TVGB was there to cover any and all gaming content at the show. 
                Like last year, my focus is on the one AAA franchise born and raised in Chicago: 
                Mortal Kombat. Last year I got a look at the past of the series by meeting the original cast. 
                But this time I was going to get a look at the franchise’s future with a panel all about the 
                soon-upcoming Mortal Kombat 11. So, I donned a new update to an old favorite cosplay 
                (I call this version “Fyfflux”) and headed over to McCorkmick Place to check it out. 
            </p>

                Let’s get the big news out of the way first: two exciting characters for the game were 
                revealed for the first time at this panel. First up, accidentally shown off a bit early 
                due to a presenter error, was fan favorite character Noob Saibot. As Ed Boon and the other 
                representatives from Netherrealm Studios explained, Noob has a new look with armored accents and 
                some silver mixed in with the black. The former Sub-Zero was missing from Mortal Kombat X, so it’s 
                good to see him here. But the other announcement, for the game’s first DLC character, was possibly 
                even more exciting. We saw a trailer for the Krypt in MK11, a series stalwart feature that has players 
                travel through a crypt to open chests that unlock alternate costumes, concept art, etc. This time around, 
                the Krypt will have a guide in the form of Shang Tsung. But not just any Shang Tsung: this one is based on 
                and played by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, who played the character in the cult Mortal Kombat film back in 1995. 
                This really came out of nowhere, but exemplifies the less serious side of Netherrealm Studios. No release 
                date was given for the DLC, but at least we’ll see him in the Krypt when the game launches.
