                For years it was said that Stephen King's IT was an unfilmmable novel
                -- but director Andres Muschietti has proven that idea to be very wrong.
                While it's true that the entire story couldn't be crammed into just one movie, 
                the filmmaker did an impressive job bringing to life half of the epic in his 
                adaptation, and now audiences are hotly anticipating the follow-up, IT Chapter 
                Two. And that's the project that we're here today to discuss.

                IT has managed to become one of the most successful horror movies of all time, 
                and, as such, the sequel has quickly started moving through development. 
                But when will it come out? Who is going to be at the helm? What can we 
                expect from the main characters? We'll dive into all of that and more 
                below and on the next few pages, so read on and learn What We Know So Far about IT Chapter Two!

                When IT was released in 2016, Warner Bros. had ideas about a sequel, 
                but they also weren't confident enough in the possibility to carve out 
                a release date for the project. That changed very fast when the the 
                film had the biggest horror movie opening of all time, and now we know 
                that IT Chapter Two will be hitting theaters everywhere on September 6, 2019.
