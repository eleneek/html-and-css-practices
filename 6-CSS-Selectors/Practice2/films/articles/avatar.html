                We've seen a lot of absolutely gigantic blockbusters over the last 
                five years, from the record-shattering performance of James Gunn's 
                Guardians of the Galaxy to Peyton Reed's summer hit Ant-Man to Zack 
                Snyder's Superman reboot Man of Steel, but none of them have been able 
                to come anywhere close to the high bar set by James Cameron's Avatar. 
                Released in December 2009, the film continues to hold the record as the 
                highest-grossing movie of all time, pulling in $2.782 billion worldwide. 
                We have been patiently waiting for sequels to arrive ever since, and 
                while the filmmaking team behind the franchise has been taking its time, 
                they have some absolutely gigantic plans for the future.

                Just like we've done for Captain America: Civil War, Batman V Superman, 
                and many other major blockbuster movies, we have put together a special 
                guide to help all of you keep track of the latest developments of Avatar 
                2 and beyond. Who from the cast of the first movie is coming back? 
                Where will the new story take us? Read on to find out!

                Right now, the plan is to release Avatar 2 sometime in December 2018. 
                The only problem with this forecasting is that the film has missed several 
                production start dates and potential release dates already. With all the 
                delays the film has experienced, plus the new plan to film all four sequels 
                at once, it's entirely possible that the movie will blow through this proposed release date once again.
