                The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going strong since it 
                launched in 2008 with Iron Man, and while movies like Spider-Man: 
                Far From Home, Black Widow, Black Panther 2, and more will keep the 
                franchise going into its Phase Four and beyond, the end of an era is 
                approaching. Avengers: Endgame will conclude not just Phase Three of the 
                MCU, but also wrap up numerous plot threads. While Avengers: Infinity War 
                was long advertised as the biggest Marvel movie yet, rest assured that 
                its follow-up will be just as important, if not more so.

                Because Avengers: Endgame is such a big deal for the franchise, 
                Marvel Studios is, understandably, keeping details for Earth's 
                Mightiest Heroes' fourth epic tale close to the chest. However, 
                there is a fair amount of information that's already available to the 
                public, including a teaser trailer, so read on to find out what we know 
                about the movie so far. Be warned, though. This guide is filled with 
                SPOILERS both mild and extreme about Infinity War and Ant-Man and The 
                Wasp, so proceed with caution if you haven't seen either film yet!

                Given that Avengers: Endgame is going to be one of the biggest movies of 
                all time, the marketing team behind the movie hasn't exactly been super 
                active - though the good news is that they have released two trailers so 
                far. The first preview from the blockbuster dropped online and in theaters 
                in December 2018, and fans have been rewatching it over and over trying to 
                squeeze out as many details as they can (something which will probably be 
                evident as you continue reading this guide). The most recent dropped during 
                the Super Bowl, albeit it was more of an extended TV spot than a full preview.
