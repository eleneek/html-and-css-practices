                It's true that DC Comics has beat Marvel Studios to the box 
                office with their first female-led superhero blockbuster in the 
                form of 2017's Wonder Woman, but the folks at the House of Ideas truthfully 
                aren't trailing too far behind. As was officially announced in October 2014, 
                the comic book studio is officially moving forward with a Captain Marvel movie, 
                and it will be here before we know it.

                Given the source material and the talent involved, it's easily 
                one of our most anticipated projects of the coming year, and we'll be 
                keeping a very close eye on it. It's for this reason that we've organized this guide, 
                used to keep track of all the latest developments of the Captain Marvel movie. 
                So, where do things currently stand, and what do we know so far? Read on and find out!

                Actually, because the premiere of Captain Marvel is less than a month 
                away as of this writing, we've gotten a pretty good look at the film and what 
                at least some of the main themes will be. Both trailers, combined with a quick 
                teaser that was shown during the Super Bowl and other footage have given us a good look 
                at the main players, delved into some of the issues that will be faced and shown off some 
                amazing action sequences as well as given us a taste of Captain Marvel's powers.
