                Move over, Bloodborne and Dark Souls, there’s a new kid on the playground and his 
                name is Sekiro, which means “best From Soft game ever” in Japanese (it doesn’t). 
                Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is the newest game from From Software that has neatly 
                settled into the Soulsborne “genre” by being, in my opinion, the most unforgiving yet. 
                Disclaimer: I haven’t played a Dark Souls game, so my opinions on that specific series 
                has been sourced from other individuals, but I can say with certainty that Sekiro blows 
                Bloodborne out of the water purely in terms of difficulty.

                Sekiro is set in the (fictionally-depicted) Ashina region of Japan and loosely 
                based on the real story of the Ashina clan from the end of the Sengoku Era. 
                You play as Wolf, a shinobi who was rescued on the battlefield as a child by 
                his adoptive shinobi father, Owl. He is tasked with the important lifelong role of protecting the Divine Heir, Kuro.

                In this period of time, the Ashina territory and clan are under threat from the Internal 
                Ministry (basically the government of Japan proper). A series of events at the beginning 
                of the game revolving around rescuing Kuro results in Wolf losing an arm and gaining the 
                power to revive in battle once (or more after acquiring certain combinations of skills) 
                after being killed. This newfound power is bestowed upon Wolf by Kuro through certain means, 
                and together with a special shinobi prosthetic arm gifted by the mysterious Sculptor, Wolf 
                becomes quite the powerful character indeed.
