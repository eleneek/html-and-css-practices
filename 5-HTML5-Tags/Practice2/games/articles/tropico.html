                Tropico 6 is a refreshing update to the long-running island building sim. 
                While the game has notable similarities to its predecessors, there are some 
                refreshing ideas here that make this possibly the best Tropico yet. 
                So how does El President fair after nearly 20 years of Tropico?

            <p>
                As I mentioned previously, Tropico 6 is an island building and management sim. 
                Each map that you play has objectives and missions to complete in order to win 
                the map and move onto the next one. These objectives/missions of each map have 
                general themes that you’ll be building towards and/or working against. These 
                elements make it rewarding to start a new map and complete it; you will be cycling 
                through this gameplay loop for the entirety of the game. Players manage resources, 
                imports/exports, tourists, citizens, and competing interest among different factions 
                that inhabit your island. You’ll also have to appease foreign groups who will have 
                interest in your budding island nation. While you juggle all of these items, don’t 
                forget that you’ll need to continue your reign as El Presidente by surviving 
                elections and attacks from rebels.

                If you’ve played a Tropico game before, none of these points will surprise you. 
                So what sets Tropico 6 apart from Tropico 1-5 apart from graphical and quality of life updates?
