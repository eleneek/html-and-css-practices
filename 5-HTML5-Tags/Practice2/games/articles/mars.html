                I first had the opportunity to play Mars Underground as a demo at PAX AUS 2018 
                and immediately signed up to play it as soon as it was available. Months later, 
                here we are with a full version of the game to play – but how does it hold up? 
                Let’s delve in, over and over and over and over and over…
            </p>

                Mars Underground is basically like Groundhog Day: The Modern NES Game. 
                Mars, his mother, and his sister Helga have moved into the quirky little 
                town of Phobos after an undisclosed issue involving Mars happened in their 
                previous town that required them to leave. On the first cycle, everything 
                seems fairly normal, with a few small quirks indicating that weird things are going to happen soon.

            <p>
                Every day/cycle starts with Mars’ alarm going off. 
                On the first cycle, the option to do anything other than sleep in is 
                greyed out, indicating it will be available later. You go to school, 
                and then have to go to an appointment with your psychologist. You don’t 
                get the option to say anything other than the wordless “…” and he gives 
                you medication that you “must” take every day. Taking the medication resets 
                the day and a new cycle begins. This is, obviously, a major game mechanic 
                that you can use whether things are going well or to speed things up so you 
                can use something you acquired on an earlier cycle.
