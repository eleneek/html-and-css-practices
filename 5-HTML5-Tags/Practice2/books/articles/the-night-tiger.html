                A weretiger. A houseboy on a mission.
                A dancehall girl who gains possession 
                of a cursed item. An English doctor with
                a secret—or rather, many secrets. Choo 
                mixes these characters together in 1930s
                Malaysia in her gripping historical novel
                The Night Tiger, which the Amazon editors
                picked as our #1 Best Book of the Month for
                February. The Night Tiger also recently won 
                a spot on the New York Times bestseller list.

                When I spoke by phone with Yangsze Choo,
                she described her novel as "part murder 
                mystery and pop ghost story." But Choo 
                quickly focused on a theme that appears 
                within the novel over and over again: 
                "I was thinking a lot about dualities, 
                mirror worlds… how something could exist 
                in two spaces at the same time. You have 
                the world of the living, and the world of 
                the spirits. The world of servants and 
                masters who live in the same space but 
                occupy completely different emotional and 
                psychological lives."  
            </p>

                One of her mother's memories about the 
                shared spaces of servants and masters 
                prompted Choo's creation of the 11-year-old 
                houseboy, Ren, whose devotion to his late 
                master underpins much of the story.

                When Choo's mother was 12 or 13 and living in 
                Malaysia, she went to visit a friend who had 
                a position in a big house. Choo's mother 
                would "come in through the kitchen door and 
                sit there and admire her friend who had a job. 
                Not so long ago children were working—and in 
                many parts of the world they still are—and I 
                thought about how amazing that was and at the 
                same time how little the masters knew about 
                what was going on in the kitchen. They had no 
                idea that local kids are coming in and sitting 
                there admiring your ice box and things like that."

                Ren, though young, is filled with zeal for the 
                mission that he was tasked with by his late 
                master: to find a missing mummified finger 
                and bury it in his master's grave so that 
                his master's spirit won't roam the earth. 
                Said Choo, "I started this book off with 
                a scene in my head, and that scene was the 
                old man dying. He's telling his servant—a 
                child servant—to do something which is really 
                quite gruesome and tragic, and yet there's a 
                lot of expectation, there's responsibility, 
                and there is even a nobility of purpose."

                Choo's other key character, Ji Lin, works 
                part-time in a dance hall in order to pay 
                off her mother's mah jongg debts. Ren and 
                Ji Lin's lives are destined to collide when 
                Ji Lin accidentally comes in possession of 
                the mummified finger that Ren so desperately 
                seeks. When she tries to return it to the 
                man who dropped it, she discovers that he 
                has died in a freak accident and the finger 
                is believed to be cursed. Ji Lin figures out 
                that it may have been stolen from a nearby 
                hospital, and she takes a temporary job there 
                to try to return it. Ren's new English master, 
                the young Dr. Acton, works at the hospital.
