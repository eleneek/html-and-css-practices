                The Yoo family are Korean immigrants plying an unusual trade, running a pressurized 
                oxygen chamber participants use in the hopes of improving conditions ranging from autism 
                to infertility. When a horrific explosion at the facility leaves two dead, the case against 
                the alleged culprit is not as open and shut as it first appears...Angie Kim’s 
                intricately-plotted courtroom thriller, Miracle Creek, isn’t a conventional whodunit 
                where the bad guy is eventually unmasked and the reader closes the book with righteous 
                satisfaction. Kim has weaved a more complicated web than that, one that ensnares characters 
                many readers will empathize with--well-meaning but flawed, doing foolish things for noble 
                reasons--and that only adds to the suspense. Here, Kim talks about how a drawing included in 
                the Asian American exhibition at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery inspired the writing of this impressive debut.

                In April 2012, I attended the first-ever Asian American exhibition at the Smithsonian 
                National Portrait Gallery and was mesmerized by My Life Strands, a charcoal drawing on a 
                paper scroll—a long braid of coarse black hair, coming together tighter and tighter until 
                the three strands became one and flowed onto the ground like a winding river. I started 
                working on my novel, Miracle Creek, that summer, and this image stayed with me as I wrote, 
                until ultimately, my novel became the literary equivalent of that drawing: a story woven from 
                three of my life strands that are elemental to who I am today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first strand is my childhood as a Korean immigrant. When I was eleven, my parents and I 
                moved from Seoul, South Korea, to Baltimore, where I lived with my aunt and uncle while my 
                parents ran and lived in a grocery store in a dangerous part of downtown Baltimore. I went 
                from feeling like a smart girl with close friends in Korea to being a foreigner in an American 
                middle school, not speaking or understanding the language, not wearing the right clothes, not 
                knowing anyone. I lost my voice. There’s a lot of that formative experience in the story I tell 
                about Mary Yoo and her family’s struggle to adjust to America and the way they lost their closeness 
                with each other along the way.

            </p>
            <p>
                The second strand comes from the last 15 years of my life, as the mother of three children 
                with wide-ranging medical issues that required, among other things, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). 
                My son was four years old when he was diagnosed with celiac disease and ulcerative colitis. 
                The standard treatments weren’t working—he was crying that his stomach hurt and throwing up and 
                losing weight, the outlines of his ribs protruding through his skin—so we decided to try an 
                experimental treatment I’d heard about, involving breathing pure oxygen inside a pressurized 
                chamber. The first time we saw the HBOT chamber, with its thick steel walls, portholes, and hatch 
                opening, my son said, “It’s a submarine!” (We’d watched the Beatles’ Yellow Submarine for family 
                movie night earlier that summer.)
            </p>
            <p>
                We went into the submarine twice a day for hour-long “dives” that summer, sealed inside the 
                group chamber with three other families. Because of the presence of pure oxygen and the risk 
                of fire that entailed, we couldn’t bring anything in—no phones, toys, electronics, magazines—leaving 
                us with nothing to do but talk. We shared life stories and traded information about the various 
                illnesses our kids were contending with. It was a wholly immersive and intense experience, and later, 
                when I started thinking about writing a novel, I thought immediately of the submarine, the intimacy 
                and confessional honesty that developed in that dark, sealed environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                The third and final strand that brought all the threads and characters into a coherent whole was 
                my experience as a trial lawyer, which gave me the tools to structure Miracle Creek around four 
                days of a murder trial. As a foundational matter, once I decided to explore the aftermath of a horrific 
                tragedy, it seemed natural to have a criminal trial anchor the story, given my familiarity with 
                courtroom procedures and what I’ve seen of the heightened interpersonal conflicts that setting can 
                produce. The courtroom’s demand for “the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth” can 
                rattle even the most confident witness and have them questioning their own memories and the blurry 
                line between insignificant omissions and outright lies. And although I considered advancing the mystery 
                element of the plot through other vehicles (such as private-eye or police investigations), the inherent 
                drama of the courtroom—the witness on a raised platform telling their stories to an audience—and the 
                couldn’t-be-higher stakes of the death penalty ultimately convinced me that the courtroom would be the 
                best setting to maximize the suspense and tension.
